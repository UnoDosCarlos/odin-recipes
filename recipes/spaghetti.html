        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the tomato paste and 750ml (3 cups) water in a large saucepan. Season with salt and bring just to the boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to very low to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a very large frying pan over high heat. Add the sause and chilli flakes. Bring to the boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes or until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Lay the pasta in the tomato sauce mixture over the base of the pan (do not stir). Spoon the tomato sauce mixture around the pasta, and over the top, to cover. Cook, without stirring, for 2-3 minutes or until the pasta starts to caramelise underneath and char slightly.</li>
            <li>Ladle about 125ml (1/2 cup) of the simmering tomato stock over the pasta. Use tongs to turn the pasta over. Cook, without stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until the liquid is completely absorbed and the pasta continues to caramelise underneath. Repeat, adding the remaining tomato stock, a ladleful at a time, and cooking for 1-2 minutes before adding the next ladleful, allowing the pasta to continue to caramelise between batches, or until al dente. This will take 15-17 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide pasta mixture among serving bowls and top with parmesan, to serve. Watch our step-by-step video below to see how to make our One-pan caramelised tomato spaghetti recipe.</li>
